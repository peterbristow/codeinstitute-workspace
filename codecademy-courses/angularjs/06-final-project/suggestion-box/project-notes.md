+ A view for the whole list of suggestions.
+ A way to input suggestions.
+ A way to upvote suggestions.

### Does a suggestion box app cause any problems that a real suggestion box doesnâ€™t?
+ People could falsify the results.


## Translate needs into the building blocks of code ##
+ A view is going to be an HTML file, and we can feed into it a list of suggestions from a controller.
+ To input suggestions, we will need to write a form that updates the model of our app. It will update it using a controller, since the controller is the middle-man between the view and the model.
+ To upvote a suggestion, we can add a button that changes the amount of upvotes a specific suggestion has in the model.
+ To comment on a suggestion, we will need to add routing to add another view. We can use similar ideas as above to build out the comments functionality.
