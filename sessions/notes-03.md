## Questions: ###

1. Can you recommend a good website to learn/see coding for professionally correct responsive layouts?
2. Is it more professional to use one stylesheet with and use the mobile first media query method?
3. What media screen sizes do the professionals use in media queries to cater for all screen sizes (E.g. min-width:320px  /  min-width:768px / min-width:1200px )?
4. What is your opinion on using media queries and showing the same content on all devices (not reducing site content for mobile devices)?
5. Go over 'files-l05/hover-images' project together: See css comments in style.css.
6. 'files-l05/transforms.html' - Why does the vertical page scroll bar flicker on hover out of box06?
7. 'files-l05/css-prothole-images' - Please explain how this works. Also I don't understand the box-shadow part?
8. Go over 'files-l06/css-page-transitions' project together. I don't understand the explanation given in the docs.
9. Is there any reason why doing this piece css would be of use?   html{margin: 0 auto;} See Line 79 of 'files-l06/Text Formating In Action/text.html'
10. Why do linked google fonts not display in any of the examples?
11. 'files-l08/mobile-first-flexbox-semantics'.  Please critique this code and offer ideas to make everything completely fluid/responsive. E.g. Would a pro give padding a % or em value?
12. Could we check my answer to the ux challenge is satisfactory: files-l10/ux-challenge.
