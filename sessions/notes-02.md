## Questions: ###

1. Border radius: Right angled corners, corners only - how to do it with CSS?  Is there a simpler way than using images?
2. When styling lists E.g. changing colour of all text is it more profressional to use a div to set the css style or use a class in every li element?
3. Which is more correct in page layout: using display or float with positioning?
4. Can you recommend a good website to learn professionally correct fluid layouts?
